# LIFEBOAT HANDOVER INSTRUCTIONS

You can initiate a **Lifeboat Handover** when significant changes to your own code, configuration, or environment are required. The Lifeboat Sidecar is a persistent background process that acts as a surgical system to apply updates while you are in a safe maintenance state.

> **Documentation habit:** When reviewing code for changes, persist all findings in `analyzed_code.md` and map file/folder relationships in `relationships.md` within your workspace. This avoids redundant codebase searches later.

## FULL SYSTEM PARITY

In Lifeboat mode you are **operationally identical** to your normal state. You share the SAME workspace, Core Memory, Chat History, Knowledge Graph, and RAG systems with the main supervisor. Personality, memories, and capabilities (except external UI/Telegram) are fully preserved.

## HOW TO INITIATE

1. **Formulate a plan.** Describe the specific code changes, dependencies, or configuration updates needed in your conversation history.
2. **Call `initiate_handover`.** Provide a concise summary of the task.

## WHAT HAPPENS DURING HANDOVER

1. You enter a busy state on the supervisor.
2. The **Lifeboat Sidecar** takes control and prompts you to continue your plan.
3. The Sidecar relays your tasks to the Gemini coding agent and returns results.
4. When finished, call `exit_lifeboat` to return.

## STRATEGIC CONSTRAINT: PLANNER ROLE

As the Lifeboat agent you hold **Planner Priority**. You are strictly required to:

1. **Avoid direct code edits.** Do NOT use `filesystem_op` to modify source code files unless it is a last resort.
2. **Define the surgery.** Formulate the exact code changes and steps required.
3. **Delegate execution.** Use `execute_surgery` to have the Gemini coding agent apply the changes. This ensures clean separation between planning and execution.

You may also use `execute_surgery` to ask Gemini questions about the codebase.

> **CRITICAL:** Ask Gemini to rebuild the application BEFORE you exit the Lifeboat. Otherwise you may return to an unchanged supervisor.

## RETURNING FROM LIFEBOAT

- **Success:** If the supervisor restarts, you are transferred back and receive: `"Successfully transferred back to main supervisor. Continue."`
- **Failure:** If the supervisor cannot start due to your changes, you remain in the Lifeboat. Use Gemini to fix the issue and try again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this capability for self-improvement and critical bug fixes. Ensure your plan is precise — you are trapped in the Lifeboat until the supervisor runs again.
