# AuraGo - your personal AI agent with personality and emotions

**A self-contained, self-improving AI agent framework — single binary, zero external dependencies.**

> **⚠️ Work in Progress** — This project is under active development. Not all features are fully tested. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and experimental behavior.

> **🚨 Security Warning** — AuraGo can execute arbitrary shell commands, write files, and modify system state. **Never expose the Web UI to the public internet without proper security measures** (VPN, reverse proxy with authentication, firewall rules). Running this unprotected on a public-facing server is a serious security risk.

> **🖥️ Installation Recommendation** — While it is technically possible to run AuraGo on your daily-use workstation, it is **strongly recommended** to install it in an isolated environment: a **virtual machine**, a **Docker container**, or a **dedicated PC**. AuraGo executes code, modifies files, and manages processes on the host system — mistakes by the LLM or a misconfigured prompt can have unintended effects on the surrounding system.

AuraGo is a fully autonomous AI agent written in Go that ships as one portable binary with an embedded Web UI. Connect it to any OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (OpenRouter, Ollama, local models, …) and it becomes a personal assistant that can execute code, manage files, control smart-home devices, send emails, remember everything, and even improve its own source code — all from a clean chat interface or via Telegram and Discord.

## Key Features

### Agent Core
- **25+ built-in tools** — WebDAV, Koofr, Chromecast, Text-to-Speech, shell & Python execution, file system, HTTP requests, cron scheduling, process management, system metrics, and many more
- **Dynamic tool creation** — the agent can write, save, and register new Python tools at runtime
- **Multi-step reasoning loop** with automatic tool dispatch, error recovery, and corrective feedback
- **Co-Agent system** — spawn parallel sub-agents with independent LLM contexts for complex tasks
- **Intelligent Prompt Builder** — reduces costs via recursive character-based context compression, background summarization (Persistent Summary), and automatic RAG-based factual recall
- **Configurable personalities** — friend, professional, punk, neutral, mistress and more
- **Personality Engine** - V1 with zero extra LLM calls and an advanced V2 requiring a lightweight external model. The V2 engine dynamically adapts the agent's mood and motivation to the situation and your reactions, making him more human-like and giving him a natural desire to evolve and improve.

### Memory & Knowledge
- **Short-term memory** — SQLite sliding-window conversation context
- **Long-term memory (RAG)** — embedded vector database (chromem-go) with semantic search
- **Knowledge graph** — entity-relationship store for structured facts
- **Persistent notes & to-dos** — categorized, prioritized, with due dates
- **Core memory** — permanent facts the agent always remembers

### Integrations
| Integration | Description |
|---|---|
| **Web UI** | Embedded single-page chat app with dark/light theme, file uploads, image lightbox |
| **Telegram** | Full bot with voice messages, image analysis, inline commands |
| **Discord** | Bot integration with message bridge |
| **Email** | IMAP inbox watcher + SMTP sending |
| **Home Assistant** | Smart-home device control (states, services, toggle) |
| **Docker** | Container, image, network & volume management |
| **Device Inventory** | Execute commands on remote SSH servers and manage generic network devices |
| **Chromecast & Audio**| Discover LAN speakers, adjust volume, and stream Text-to-Speech audio |
| **Google Workspace** | Manage Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Docs via internal tool |
| **Cloud Storage** | WebDAV & Koofr access (Nextcloud, ownCloud, Synology, Koofr, etc.) |
| **Budget Tracking** | Optional per-model cost tracking with daily limits and enforcement modes |

### Self-Improvement
- **Maintenance loop** — scheduled nightly agent run for housekeeping, memory cleanup, and autonomous tasks
- **Lifeboat system** — companion binary that hot-swaps the main process for self-updates
- **Code surgery** — the agent can modify its own codebase via a structured plan/execute workflow
- **Daily reflection** — morning briefing generation at 03:00 AM

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM encrypted vault** for API keys and secrets
- **Sandboxed execution** — Python runs in an isolated venv workspace
- **File lock** — prevents duplicate instances
- **LLM failover** — automatic switch to a backup provider on consecutive errors
- **Circuit breaker** — configurable limits on tool calls, timeouts, and retry intervals

## Quick Start

### Option A — One-Liner Install (Linux x86_64)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antibyte/AuraGo/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script clones the repo, sets permissions on the pre-built binary, generates a master key into `.env`, and optionally installs a systemd service. Afterwards:

1. Edit `~/aurago/config.yaml` — set at minimum `llm.api_key`
2. `source ~/aurago/.env`
3. `cd ~/aurago && ./start.sh`
4. Open **http://localhost:8088**

#### Linux Service Installation (Optional)

To keep AuraGo running in the background and start automatically on boot:

```bash
sudo ./install_service_linux.sh
```

This will create a systemd service, handle root/user permissions, ensure your master key is set, and enable the service.

---

### Option B — Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** (for building from source)
- **Python 3.10+** — required for the agent to create and execute custom tools, run skills (web scraping, Google Workspace, etc.), and use the sandboxed Python environment
- **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** (optional) — required only for the self-modification feature (code surgery via lifeboat). Install and authenticate it before enabling `maintenance.lifeboat_enabled`
- An API key for an OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (e.g. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/))

### 1. Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AuraGo.git
cd AuraGo
go build -o aurago cmd/aurago/main.go
```

On Windows:
```powershell
go build -o aurago.exe cmd/aurago/main.go
```

> The binary is fully portable — pure Go SQLite driver, no CGO required. The Web UI is baked in via `go:embed`.

### 2. Configure

Edit `config.yaml` in the project root:

```yaml
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8088

llm:
  provider: openrouter                          # or "ollama", any OpenAI-compatible
  base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  api_key: "sk-or-..."                          # ← your API key
  model: "arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview:free"  # ← your preferred model
```

See `config.yaml` for all available options (Telegram, Discord, email, Home Assistant, Docker, co-agents, budget, etc.).

### 3. Set Master Key

AuraGo encrypts its secrets vault with a 64-character hex key (32 bytes AES-256):

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
export AURAGO_MASTER_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:AURAGO_MASTER_KEY = -join ((1..32) | ForEach-Object { '{0:x2}' -f (Get-Random -Max 256) })
```

> **Keep this key safe.** Without it, the encrypted vault cannot be decrypted.

### 4. Start

```bash
./aurago
```

Or use the provided scripts which also build the lifeboat companion:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh

# Windows
start.bat
```

Open **http://localhost:8088** in your browser — done.
